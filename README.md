## WeatherPy Challenge

1. Successfully generated a cities.csv with weather data for 588 cities.
2. Created the scatter plots and linear regressions as required.

## VacationPy Challenge
1. Successfully generated a humidity heat-map from the cities.csv file.
2. Was getting too few cities with the 70 - 80 temperature range so I reduced the lower bound to 60 degrees Fahrenheit and got 13 cities.
3. Successfully used the google API to find 13 closest hotels and place the markers on the map.

I used the DOWNLOAD THE MAP AS PNG to save both the heat-maps and the hotel markers map. I couldn't get the code right to do this and all my google searches recommended this as the solution.
